Artifact: An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project.
 Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is identified by a group id, an artifact ID, a version, an extension and a classifier (extension+classifier may be named by a type).

GroupId: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project. While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections), it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
